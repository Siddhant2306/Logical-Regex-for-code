# Logical-Regex-for-code

This project creates an intelligent code translation system that understands what your code does (its logic and
effects) rather than how it's written (its syntax). When you write Python code and request C++ output, the
system doesn't just swap syntax—it recognizes the underlying computational effects and re-expresses them
using idiomatic patterns in the target language.


Key Differentiators
-Semantic preservation over syntactic translation
-Effect-based reasoning about memory, mutability, and ownership
-Educational explanations for every translation choice
-Language-agnostic intermediate representation
-Extensible architecture for adding new languages
